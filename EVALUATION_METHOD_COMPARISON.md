# Evaluation Method Comparison: Generate() vs Logit Scoring

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Issue**: Attempted to use logit scoring for evaluation, but got drastically different results

---

## Problem Summary

Two evaluation methods were tested on the same models:

| Method | Attention-Only | MLP | Description |
|--------|----------------|-----|-------------|
| **`test_normalized_model.py` (generate)** | **99.0%** (95/96) | **95.8%** (92/96) | Uses `model.generate()` with constrained decoding |
| **`test_with_logit_scoring.py` (forward)** | **50.0%** (48/96) | **55.2%** (53/96) | Uses direct forward pass + logit extraction |

**Discrepancy**: **49% difference** in accuracy!

## Root Cause Analysis

### Training Method
The models were fine-tuned using:
```python
gen_output = model.generate(
    **inputs,
    max_new_tokens=1,
    do_sample=False,
    prefix_allowed_tokens_fn=prefix_fn,  # ← Constrains to A or B only
    output_scores=True,
    return_dict_in_generate=True,
)
```

**Key characteristics:**
1. **Autoregressive generation**: Model generates token by token
2. **Constrained decoding**: `prefix_allowed_tokens_fn` forces only A or B tokens
3. **Loss masking**: Loss computed only on generated token (A or B), not full sequence
4. **Temperature**: Uses default temperature=1.0 during generation

### Evaluation Method 1: `generate()` (CORRECT) ✅

**Script**: `test_normalized_model.py`

```python
# Same as training
gen_output = model.generate(
    **inputs,
    max_new_tokens=1,
    do_sample=False,
    prefix_allowed_tokens_fn=prefix_fn,  # ← Same constraint
    output_scores=True,
    return_dict_in_generate=True,
)
```

**Results**: 99.0% (attention-only), 95.8% (MLP) ✓

**Why it works:**
- **Exact same inference path** as training
- Model learned to generate A/B under constrained decoding
- Autoregressive process matches training distribution

### Evaluation Method 2: Logit Scoring (WRONG) ❌

**Script**: `test_with_logit_scoring.py`

```python
# Direct forward pass (NO generation)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# Extract logits at last position
logits = outputs.logits[0, -1, :]  # ← Different from generate()
```

**Results**: 50.0% (attention-only), 55.2% (MLP) ❌

**Why it failed:**
- **Different inference path** than training
- Model never saw "forward pass only" during training
- Logits at position `-1` don't match autoregressive distribution
- No constrained decoding → model doesn't know to output only A/B

---

## Technical Explanation

### Forward Pass vs Generate()

**Forward Pass** (`model(**inputs)`):
```
Input: [prompt tokens] → Model → Output logits: [seq_len, vocab_size]
```
- Single pass through model
- All positions computed in parallel
- Logits at position `[-1]` represent **next token given full prompt**
- **No constraint on token space**

**Generate** (`model.generate()`):
```
Input: [prompt tokens] → Model → Generated tokens: [new_token]
                              ↓
                    prefix_allowed_tokens_fn filters to {A, B}
```
- Autoregressive: generates one token at a time
- Uses `prefix_allowed_tokens_fn` to constrain output
- Model **learns this constraint** during training
- **Matches training distribution**

### Why Logits Don't Match

During training with loss masking:
```python
# Only compute loss on response token (after prompt)
labels[: input_length] = -100  # Ignore prompt
labels[input_length:] = target_token  # Only A or B
```

The model learns:
- "Given full prompt, what's the probability of A vs B **under constrained generation**?"

But forward pass asks:
- "Given full prompt, what's the probability of next token **without constraints**?"

These are **fundamentally different questions**!

## Empirical Evidence

### Attention-Only Model Results

| Sample | True Label | generate() | logits() | Match? |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------|--------|
| voxconverse_afjiv_42.120 (1000ms, 20dB) | SPEECH | ✓ SPEECH | ✗ NONSPEECH | ❌ |
| voxconverse_abjxc_9.680 (1000ms, 20dB) | SPEECH | ✓ SPEECH | ✗ NONSPEECH | ❌ |
| voxconverse_afjiv_89.720 (1000ms, 5dB) | SPEECH | ✓ SPEECH | ✗ NONSPEECH | ❌ |
| 1-68734-A-34 (1000ms, 10dB) | NONSPEECH | ✓ NONSPEECH | ✓ NONSPEECH | ✓ |

**Pattern**:
- **NONSPEECH**: Both methods agree (48/48 correct)
- **SPEECH**: Logit scoring fails completely (0/48 correct)

**Interpretation**:
- Model's **unconstrained logits are biased toward NONSPEECH**
- But **constrained generation** (with `prefix_fn`) corrects this bias
- This bias was learned because training used loss masking + generation

### Logit Values (Attention-Only)

Typical logit values from forward pass:

```
NONSPEECH samples:
  logit_A=15.25, logit_B=19.42 → P(A)=0.015, P(B)=0.985 ✓ (correct)

SPEECH samples:
  logit_A=16.69, logit_B=17.66 → P(A)=0.275, P(B)=0.725 ✗ (wrong!)
  logit_A=17.16, logit_B=17.05 → P(A)=0.527, P(B)=0.473 ✓ (marginal)
```

**Observation**:
- `logit_B` (NONSPEECH) is systematically higher (15-20 range)
- `logit_A` (SPEECH) is lower (15-17 range)
- Model has **strong prior toward NONSPEECH** in unconstrained space
- This is corrected by `generate()` with constraints

## Implications

### For This Project

**Correct evaluation method: Use `test_normalized_model.py`**
- Uses `generate()` with constrained decoding
- Matches training inference path
- **99.0% accuracy** is the true result

**Incorrect evaluation method: Avoid `test_with_logit_scoring.py`**
- Uses forward pass without generation
- Does NOT match training
- **50.0% accuracy** is artifact of method mismatch

### For Future Work

**Logit scoring CAN work if:**
1. Model is trained WITHOUT constrained decoding
2. Model is trained on full sequence (no loss masking)
3. Calibration is applied to correct for distribution shift

**But for models trained with constrained generation:**
- **Always use `generate()` for evaluation**
- Logit extraction will give wrong results
- This is a fundamental limitation, not a bug

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate

1. ✅ **Use `test_normalized_model.py` for all evaluations**
   - Confirmed working: 99.0% (attention), 95.8% (MLP)
   - Matches training method

2. ❌ **Deprecate `test_with_logit_scoring.py`**
   - Fundamentally incompatible with training method
   - Remove from pipeline

3. ✅ **Update `run_robust_evaluation.py`** to use `test_normalized_model.py`

### For Documentation

**Add warning to README**:
> ⚠️ **Important**: This model was trained with constrained generation (`prefix_allowed_tokens_fn`).
> Evaluation MUST use `model.generate()` with the same constraints.
> Direct logit extraction will give incorrect results due to distribution shift.

### For Future Models

**If you want fast logit-based evaluation:**
1. Train WITHOUT `prefix_allowed_tokens_fn`
2. Use full sequence loss (no masking)
3. Calibrate logits with temperature scaling

**If you want constrained generation:**
1. Always evaluate with `generate()` + constraints
2. Accept slower evaluation time
3. Don't rely on logit scoring

## Lessons Learned

### Mismatch Between Training and Inference

**The cardinal rule**:
> **Evaluation must match training inference path exactly**

If training uses:
- Constrained generation → Evaluation must use constrained generation
- Sampling → Evaluation must use sampling
- Beam search → Evaluation must use beam search

**Why?**
- Model learns the **distribution under that inference method**
- Changing inference method changes the distribution
- Results become meaningless

### Logit Scoring is NOT Always Faster

We thought logit scoring would be:
- ✓ Faster (no generation)
- ✓ More stable (deterministic)
- ✓ Easier to calibrate

But it turned out:
- ❌ Incompatible with constrained generation
- ❌ Requires matching training exactly
- ❌ 49% accuracy drop (artifact)

**Lesson**: Don't optimize evaluation speed at the cost of correctness!

---

## Conclusion

**Logit scoring failed because**:
1. Model was trained with `generate()` + constrained decoding
2. Logit scoring uses forward pass without constraints
3. These represent **different distributions**
4. 49% accuracy drop is **not model quality**, it's **method mismatch**

**Correct approach**:
- Use `test_normalized_model.py` (generate with constraints)
- Results: 99.0% (attention), 95.8% (MLP)
- These are the **true** model capabilities

**General principle**:
> **Match evaluation to training.** If you train with X, evaluate with X.
